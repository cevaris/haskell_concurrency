##Haskell

Weak Head Normal Form: 

- The **seq** function evaluates its argument only as far as the first constructor, and doesnâ€™t evaluate any more of the structure.

Sparks:

- The argument passed into an **rpar** function to be executed in parallel. 

Work Stealing

- Work that is taken off the queue of **sparks** when there is an free CPU processors available to execute it.
