{- 
You have learned how to define new data types, so itâ€™s time to look at other types that could be useful for our Time Machine Store. Time machines are defined by its manufacturer, its model (which is an integer), its name, whether they can travel to the past and to the future and a price (which can be represented as a floating-point number). Define a TimeMachine data type holding that information. Try to use more than one ADT to structure the values.
